# KotlinProductService
This was an experimental project for me to play with Dropwizard and Kotlin.

Toy microservice that models product information in a supply chain context.

I abandoned my work with Javalin and switched to Dropwizard https://bitbucket.org/honstain/javalin-inventory-service-v2/src/master/

## Dependencies

Version 2.0.23
